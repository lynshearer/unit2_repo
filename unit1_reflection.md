# Unit 1 Reflection

1. What worked well during unit 1?

The main aspect that I think went the most well in unit 1 is the snakify work. For me, especially as I was relatively new to computer science,
the exercises helped me improve my coding abilities as well as broaden my awareness to new functions and facets of python. As well as this, I think
that even though I often struggled with them, overall the quizzes were interesting and also worked well to get me thinking about the most efficient
solution to the problem that was present. 

2. What did not work well?

Some things that did not go so well during unit 1 was problem solving. Sometimes, I would get extremely stuck on specific questions or codes and have
no idea how to problem solve on my own. I also believe that I have not completely acquired all the skills that I have learned/do not know enough coding
practices to support my classwork/projects. This is something that I would like to improve on but am not completely sure where would be the most 
efficient place to start. 

3. What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1?

What I enjoyed most about the unit 1 project is the freedom that we had with the success criteria. This allowed us as coders to gauge our own coding
abilities and develop code based on what we were able to and wanted to provide the client. Even so, I was a little frustrated when I misjudged my abilities
and worked extremely hard on a success criteria that I ended up having to change because I couldn't get it to work consistently. 

4. What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?

A talent that I have practiced during this unit is memorization. Although it is difficult to retain knowledge that I have learned in this class, repition
like those used in snakify helped me memorize certain techniques that are more efficient than the ones I was using previously, and what situation to use
them in.

5. What is working well for computer science for you?

Something that is working well for me is my overall organization in computer science. I believe that my repository was pretty organized and this helped me
keep track of what work I had completed and what I still needed to complete. 

6. What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?

I think sometimes that since Dr. Ruben excells in coding that sometimes he may go too fast in his explanations. I also personally need to be more proactive
and ask more questions in order for Dr. Ruben to better support me in Unit 2 because he does a good job at explaining. The only problem is that
sometimes I am not sure what questions I should be asking.
